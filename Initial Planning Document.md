Initial Planning Document
Week 0
Version 1
August 8, 2025

This document is being created with the intention of being the first of several files used to keep track of and display my part of my coding journey. As such, I am approaching this with the mindset of action and improvement instead of perfection. Despite having experience with an Agile workplace I have not yet created, maintained, and updated a set of sprint plans with myself being the sole executor. While unfamiliar, this challenge will be taken in stride.

## Abstract Goal
Create an organized schedule where I plan my sprint with action items/subtasks, push updates, and evaluate my progress. This schedule will emulate as much of Agile as is possible with an individual.


## Proposed Sprint Schedule Template

### Weekly Goals
-   Sprint Planning: Start the week by planning the overall goal to be accomplished by the end of the week and all of the associated subtasks required complete the task.
-   Documentation: All code and documents should be performed using the appropriate style guide.
-   Review: Friday mornings will be used to review the progress made overall to determine whether the predicted time estimates were accurate. Saturdays will be used to create the project's Design Document, identify weekly tasks, and create subtasks.


### Daily Goals
-   Define progress that was made in the previous day during Scrum.
-   Select subtask that will be attempted that day.
-   Update the Sprint Planning document.
-   Commit changes at the end of the day to the associated project's GitHub folder.


## Proposed Design Document Template
NOTE: This will be updated with more in depth or specific requirements after the first completed project.
Start simply at first with the four listed goals for the document at first: 
-   Description of the overall project. (Project Description)
-   Walkthrough of the intended functionality and goals. (Project Workflow)
-   List aspects that would be necessary for complete functionality. (Story Tasks)
-   Additional features that could be added in the future. (Additional Features)

## File Organization Template
Each project will consist of a Readme.md (Design Document + Current Sprint), one folder containing usable code, and one folder containing previous tasks or retrospectives.
