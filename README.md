# DND Calculator

This Design Doc will be created using guidelines described in the Initial Planning document



### Proposed Design Document Template

NOTE: This will be updated with more in depth or specific requirements after the first completed project.

Start simply at first with the four listed goals for the document at first:

1. Description of the overall project. (Project Description)

2. Walkthrough of the intended functionality and goals. (Project Workflow)

3. List aspects that would be necessary for complete functionality. (Story Tasks)

4. Additional features that could be added in the future and NOT included in the current workflow. (Additional Features)



## Project Description

Dungeons and Dragons is a popular tabletop game used to simulate combat and roleplaying. In order to practice my data visualization skills, I will create a simple web page that will allow the user to enter information about two individuals in physical combat and display statistical information about the result of the fight.



## Project Workflow

Users will input basic stats for two combatants (Attacker and Defender) which, when the "Calculate" button is pressed, will three sets of informatics will appear: 1) A pie chart depicting the odds that the attacker will win. 2) A bar chart that will display the possible rolls that the attacker and defender and a vertical line depicting the value needed to hit the other opponent (their AC). 3) A table depicting the odds that each combatant is defeated at each turn.



## Story Tasks

This project will be divided into three parts (LoE of 5 for each):

1. Frontend design (User inputs and overall aesthetic)

2. Functionality (Error handling and JS functions)

3. Data Visualization (Graphs and figures)

Each of these story tasks will be tackled in 1 week sprints with a daily subtask to accomplish.





## Additional Features

The following are "nice to have" features that are not to be added to this current iteration of the project.

- Toggle for who goes first.

- Multiple attacks.

- Calculating spells.
